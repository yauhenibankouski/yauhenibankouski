👋 Hi, I’m Yauheni (Eugene) and I am manking my first steps into a Fullstack development path taking classes at @lewagonams

💡 I got into software development to be able to write my own products, prototypes and in general be able to execute on my own ideas

👔 I am currently working as a Revenue Operations Lead for a haelth tech startup where I focus my energy on growing commercial part of the business by making sure revenue teams such as marketing, sales and finance run smooth operations. Wait! Does it make a me a Smooth Operator? Should change my title! 👮

👀 I’m interested in indie hacking and building MVPs of the ideas I have had for a long time

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ideas and problems brainstorming to see if they can be fixed together
